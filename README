My PDFs is a program to manage your PDF document collection. It will track down PDFs wherever they are located on your system and let you click on one to open it.

Scanning for PDFs is manual ATM and it does take a few minutes. But if you haven't added new PDFs recently, you can simply use the previous scan results for instant access.

This app will be further developed in the near future to speed things up.
